# 📝 Most-Used-Word-Finding

This Python project analyzes a given text and finds the **most frequently used word**. It's a simple but effective utility for basic text analysis and can be extended for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- Reads input from a `.txt` file or raw user input  
- Removes punctuation and converts text to lowercase  
- Tokenizes text into words  
- Counts and displays the most frequent word  
- Optional: Shows top N frequent words  


## 🧠 How It Works

1. Load or enter text input  
2. Preprocess the text (clean & normalize)  
3. Tokenize into words  
4. Count the frequency of each word  
5. Output the most frequently used word(s)  


## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Add GUI (Tkinter / Streamlit)  
- Visualize word frequencies with bar charts  
- Exclude common stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "and")  
- Multi-language support
